# Zzz
> A command-line MacOS sleep program (like SleepNow)

## Installation

Traditional unix-style installation:

>   1. `make Zzz`
>   3. `sudo make install`
>   4. Is `/usr/local/bin` in your `$PATH`?  If not, you can define it in your `~/.profile`

Alternatively, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to do the installation:

>   1. If needed, install brew on your mac.
>   2. `brew install Zzz`

## Running

Want to put your mac to sleep?  Type 'Zzz' and it will immediately sleep (and, of course, it can be awakened in the usual way.)
