# Zzz
> A command-line MacOS sleep program (like SleepNow)

## Installation

Traditional unix-style installation:

>   1. `make Zzz`
   2. if it doesn't exist, `mkdir ~/bin`
   3. `cp Zzz ~/bin`
   4. Is `~/bin` in your `$PATH`?  If not, you can define it in your `~/.profile`

Alternatively, you can use [Brew](https://brew.sh) to do the installation:

>   1. If needed, install brew on your mac.
   2. `brew install Zzz`

## Running

Want to put your mac to sleep?  Type 'Zzz' and it will immediately sleep (and, of course, it can be awakened in the usual way.)
